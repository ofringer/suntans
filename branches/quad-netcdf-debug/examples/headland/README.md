# Headland test case

Oscillatory flow past a headland. Demonstrates eddy shedding and its sensitivity
to resolution, grid topology, and drag.

See:

**Signell and Geyer, 1990, Transient Eddy Formation Around Headlands, JGR-Oceans.**

## This example also shows how to:

 - Generate a triangular grid w/ TOM including automatic shapefile generation

 - Generate a cartesian quad grid w/ boundaries

 - Generate a hex-dominant grid from a triangular mesh

 - Generate boundary and initial condition netcdf files for an idealised scenario
