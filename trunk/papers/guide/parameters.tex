\section{Parameter listing in suntans.dat} \label{sec:params}

The main SUNTANS input file is called \verb+suntans.dat+  and contains three
columns.  The first column contains the name of the variable used in
the program while the second column contains its value, and the information
after that value is ignored.  Lines beginning
with \verb #  are ignored, while {\bf empty lines will cause the program to 
crash}.  The SUNTANS executable looks for this file in the directory specified
by \verb+--datadir=+.  If this is not specified, then it looks for it in the
same directory as the \verb+sun+ executable.

\subsection{Physical/Computational parameters}

These parameters define values used in SUNTANS.  The syntax of the line in suntans.dat is given by
\begin{verbatim}
variablename  variablevalue   # Description of variable
\end{verbatim}
When this file is read, the effect is equivalent to \verb+variablename=variablevalue+.
This file cannot have empty lines, but the spacing between variablename and value is arbitrary, as long
as it does not contain a new line.  
Only the first variable is read before the \verb+#+ sign.  That is, old variable values can exist to
the right of the variable values being used and they are neglected.  The following line is therefore legal:
\begin{verbatim}
dt    0.025  0.05 (unstable)  0.0125 (10/12/04)  # Time step size
\end{verbatim}
This will have the effect of \verb+dt=0.025+ and neglecting the rest of the line after \verb+0.025+.

\subsubsection{Nkmax: $N_{kmax}\ge 1$}

Number of cells in the vertical.  This is used when the -g flag is
specified in order to build the vertical grid levels.  It must be
greater than or equal to 1.  

\subsubsection{stairstep: Boolean}

If stairstep is 1 then the vertical grid spacing does not change in
the horizontal. If stairstep is 0, then partial-stepping is employed and
the height of the bottom cell
is set such that the bottom face of the cell coincides with the actual
value of the depth. Otherwise (when stairstep=1), the bottom face of
of the lowermost cell is always greater than the actual depth.  

\subsubsection{rstretch: $-1.1 < r < -1$ or $1 < r < +1.1$}

Employ vertical grid stretching such that the distribution of vertical
grid spacings is given by
\[
\Delta z_k = r\,\Delta z_{k+1}\,,
\]
where $0\le \mbox{k} < \mbox{Nkmax}$.  If $r<0$ then the grid is refined near the
bottom, otherwise it is refined at the free-surface.

\subsubsection{CorrectVoronoi: Boolean}

If CorrectVoronoi is 1 then degenerate triangles are corrected using
the VoronoiRatio parameter defined below.  For a given triangulation,
stability is dictated by the smallest distance between Voronoi
points.  The worst case occurs when two right triangles abut each
other, since they have coincident Voronoi points.  In SUNTANS, the
Voronoi points are corrected if they are too close to each other
relative to the distance between the centroids of the neighboring triangles.
If triangle $1$ and $2$ have centroids defined by $(xc_1,yc_1)$ and $(xc_2,yc_2)$
and Voronoi points defined by $(xv_1,yv_1)$ and $(xv_2,yv_2)$, then the distance
between the centroids is given by
\[
D_c^2 = (xc_2-xc_1)^2 + (yc_2-yc_1)^2\,,
\]
and the distance between the Voronoi points is given by
\[
D_v^2 = (xv_2-xv_1)^2 + (yv_2-yv_1)^2\,.
\]
The Voronoi points are corrected if $D_g/D_c< V_r$, and if this
is the case, they are updated with
\begin{eqnarray}
xv_1 &=& xc + V_r(xc_1-xc)\,,\nonumber\\
yv_1 &=& yc + V_r(yc_1-yc)\,,\nonumber\\
xv_2 &=& xc + V_r(xc_2-xc)\,,\nonumber\\
yv_2 &=& yc + V_r(yc_2-yc)\,,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $xc=(xc_1+xc_2)/2$ and $yc=(yc_1+yc_2)/2$.  Using this correction methodology,
setting $V_r=1$ moves the Voronoi points to the centroids of the cells.

\subsubsection{VoronoiRatio: $0\le V_r\le 1$}

Adjustment factor for degenerate triangles.  If $V_r=1$, then
all Voronoi points are moved to the centroids, while if $V_r=0$, 
then no correction is performed.  See CorrectVoronoi.

\subsubsection{vertgridcorrect: Boolean}

For an equispaced vertical grid, the vertical grid spacing is constant and
is given by $\Delta z=D_{max}/N_{kmax}$, where $D_{max}$ is the maximum depth in the domain.
In the rare case for which the minimum depth, $D_{min}$ in the domain is less than $\Delta z$, there
are not enough grid points to resolve the region with the smallest depth.  If this is the
case and vertgridcorrect
is set to 1, then the number of vertical grid cells is adjusted such that $\Delta z=D_{min}$,
such that $N_{kmax}=D_{max}/D_{min}$.

\subsubsection{IntDepth: Boolean}

If set to 1, then the depths at the Voronoi points are interpolated from the
depth specified by the depth file (see below).  Otherwise, the depths are
specified in the file \verb+initialization.c+.

\subsubsection{dzsmall: No longer used}

\subsubsection{scaledepth: Boolean}

For debugging purposes.  If set to 1, scales the depth by scaledepthfactor (see below).

\subsubsection{scaledepthfactor}

If scaledepth=1, this scales the depth by the given amount and hence
can be used to reduce the depth and hence the surface gravity wave speed by
a desired amount.

\subsubsection{thetaramptime: $\tau_\theta >0$}

This is used to damp out transient barotropic motions by initializing
the value of $\theta$ in the free-surface solver to 1 and ramping it
down to the value of $\theta$ specified below.  The $\tau_\theta$ parameter
determines the timescale over which this is damped, such that, if the value
of $\theta$ specified below is given by $\theta_0$, then the value of
$\theta$ that is used in the calculations is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\theta(t) &=& \theta_0 + (1-\theta_0)\exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_\theta}\right)\nonumber\,.
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{beta: $\beta\ge 0$}

Expansivity of salt.  This is used in the gravity term on the right hand side of
the Navier-Stokes equations in the form
\[
-g\beta\left(s-s_0\right)\,,
\]
where $s(x,y,z,t)$ is the salinity and $s_0(z)$ is the initial salinity.  If $\beta=0$
advection of salinity is not computed.  


\subsubsection{theta: $0<\theta\le 1$}

Implicitness parameter for the free-surface solver and the vertial diffusion terms.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\theta=0$: Fully explicit (unstable)
\item $\theta=0.5$: Crank-Nicolson (neutrally stable in the linear sense)
\item $\theta=1.0$: Fully implicit
\item $\theta=0.55$: For practical simulations
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{thetaS: $0\le \theta_S \le 1$}

Implicitness parameter for vertical scalar advection and diffusion.  Note that this
value of thetaS does not necessarily share the same stability properties as the
free-surface solver since stability for scalar transport is governed by
the horizontal Courant number even when $\theta_S>0.5$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\theta_S=0$: Fully explicit 
\item $\theta_S=0.5$: Crank-Nicolson (Ensures no vertical Courant limitation for advection or diffusion)
\item $\theta_S=1.0$: Fully implicit (same as above but first-order accurate)
\item $\theta_S=\theta$: To guarantee consistency with continuity 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{thetaB: Not used}

\subsubsection{kappa\_s: $\kappa_s\ge 0$}

Laminar vertical diffusivity of salt in units of m$^2$ s$^{-1}$.  Does not affect stability.

\subsubsection{kappa\_sH: $\kappa_{sH}\ge 0$}

Laminar horizontal diffusivity of salt in units of m$^2$ s$^{-1}$.  For stability 
\[
\frac{\kappa_{sH}\Delta t}{\mbox{min}(D_g^2)}<\frac{1}{2}\,,
\]
where $D_g$ is the distance between Voronoi points.  

\subsubsection{gamma: $\gamma$: Boolean}

Temperature is implemented as a passive scalar.  If gamma is set to 0 then scalar
transport of T is not computed.

\subsubsection{kappa\_T: $\kappa_T\ge 0$}

Same as $kappa\_s$ but for T.

\subsubsection{kappa\_TH: $\nu_{TH}\ge 0$}

Same as $kappa\_TH$ but for T.

\subsubsection{nu: $\nu\ge 0$}

Laminar vertical diffusivity of momentum in units of m$^2$ s$^{-1}$.  Does not affect stability.

\subsubsection{nu\_H: $\nu_{H}\ge 0$}

Laminar horizontal diffusivity of momentum in units of m$^2$ s$^{-1}$.  For stability 
\[
\frac{\nu_{H}}{\Delta t}{\mbox{min}(D_g^2)}<\frac{1}{2}\,,
\]
where $D_g$ is the distance between Voronoi points.  

\subsubsection{tau\_T: $\tau_T$}

Parameter used in boundaries.c to employ a surface wind stress in units of m$^2$ s$^{-2}$.
See Section \ref{sec:boundary}

\subsubsection{z0T: $z_{0T}$}

Lid roughness used to calculate drag at the lid.  See CdT.

\subsubsection{z0B: $z_{0B}$}

Bottom roughness used to calculate drag at the bottom boundary layer.  See CdB.

\subsubsection{CdT: $C_{dT}$}

If the roughness at the lid is zero (i.e. z0T=0) then the drag coefficient at the lid is given by
this constant, otherwise the drag coefficient is calculated with the rough wall 
relationship
\[
C_{dT} = \left[\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta z_{top}}{z_{0T}}\right)\right]^{-2}\,.
\]
where $\Delta z_{top}$ is the thickness of the top cell.

\subsubsection{CdB: $C_{dB}$}

If the roughness at the bottom is zero (i.e. $z_{0B}$=0) then the drag coefficient at the bottom is given by
this constant, otherwise the drag coefficient is calculated with the rough wall
relationship
\[
C_{dB} = \left[\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta z_{bot}}{z_{0B}}\right)\right]^{-2}\,,
\]
where $\Delta z_{bot}$ is the thickness of the bottom cell.

\subsubsection{CdW: $C_{dW}$}

Constant drag coefficient of sidewalls.  Drag on sidewalls is only computed if the wall
does not extend up to the free surface.  For example, in a compound channel, sidewall
drag is only computed within the channel and not on the edges of the floodplain, as shown
in Figure \ref{fig:compoundchannel}.
\insertfig{0.8}{figures/compoundchannel}{Example of a compound channel, for which sidewall
drag is only computed in the channel and not on the shoals.}{fig:compoundchannel}

no turbulence model is employed.  

\subsubsection{dt: $\Delta t$}

\[
\Delta t < C\left[\frac{\min(D_g)}{\max(|U|)},\frac{\min(\Delta z)}{\max(|w|)},

\frac{1}{2}\frac{\min(D_g)^2}{\max(\kappa_{sH})},
\frac{1}{2}\frac{\min(D_g)^2}{\max(\kappa_{TH})},
\frac{1}{2}\frac{\min(D_g)^2}{\max(\nu_{H})}
\right]\,,
\]
where $c_i$ is the internal wave speed, $C$ is the relevant Courant number, and $D_g$
is the minimum Voronoi distance.

\subsubsection{Cmax: $C_{max}>0$}

Maximum permissible Courant number for advection of momentum.  

\subsubsection{nsteps: $N_{steps}\ge 0$}

Total number of time steps. 


\subsubsection{ntout: $N_{tout}> 0$}

the total number of time steps that are output is then given
by
\[
1+\mbox{floor}\left(\frac{N_{steps}}{N_{tout}}\right)\,.
\]


\subsubsection{ntprog: $0\le N_{tprog}\le 100$}

Report progress at $N_{tprog}$\% intervals if $N_{tprog}>0$, otherwise do not report
progress.  Either way, progress is reported only if the verbose flag is at least \verb+-v+.

\subsubsection{ntconserve: $0\le N_{tconserve}\le N_{steps}$}

the file specified by ConserveFile.  Output should be edited to suit user's needs in
the \verb+OutputData+ function in \verb+phys.c+.

\subsubsection{nonhydrostatic: Boolean}

calculate the vertical velocity with continuity.

\subsubsection{cgsolver: No longer used}

\subsubsection{maxiters: $I_{max,H}>0$}

Maximum number of iterations allowed of the free-surface conjugate-gradient solver before
reporting nonconvergence.  If the free-surface solver is not converging in less than 200
iterations then the problem is poorly conditioned.

\subsubsection{qmaxiters: $I_{max,Q}>0$}

Maximum number of iterations allowed of the nonhydrostatic pressure conjugate-gradient solver before
reporting nonconvergence. 

\subsubsection{qprecond: 0,1, or 2}

Type of preconditioner to use for the nonhydrostatic pressure solver.  For a typical environmental
flow with an aspect ratio of $\order{10^2}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[0] No preconditioner - 1000s of iterations to converge
\item[1] Diagonal preconditioner - 100s of iterations to converge
\item[2] Block-diagonal preconditioner - 10s of iterations to converge.
\end{enumerate}
There is no significant difference among the preconditioners when the aspect ratio is roughly 1.

\subsubsection{epsilon: $\epsilon_H>0$}

Tolerance for free-surface conjugate gradient solver.  Default: $\epsilon_H=10^{-10}$.

\subsubsection{qepsilon: $\epsilon_Q>0$}

Tolerance for nonhydrostatic pressure conjugate gradient solver.  Default: $\epsilon_Q=10^{-5}$.

\subsubsection{resnorm: Boolean}

Whether or not to normalize the residual when computing tolerance criteria for the conjugate
gradient solvers.  At a given iteration, if the residual is given by $r=b-Ax$, then tolerance is evaluated with:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[0]: error=$r^T r$
\item[1]: error=$\frac{r^T r}{b^T b}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{relax: No longer used}

if volume is not conserved to within the tolerance defined by \verb+CONSERVED+ in \verb+suntans.h+.
Prints regardless of verbosity setting at command line.

\subsubsection{masscheck: Boolean}

(0): Do not check for mass conservation, (1): check for mass conservation and print out errors
if volume is not conserved to within the tolerance defined by \verb+CONSERVED+ in \verb+suntans.h+.
Prints regardless of verbosity setting at command line.

\subsubsection{nonlinear: 0,1, or 2}

Advection scheme for momentum:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[0]: No advection of momentum, i.e. $\ub\cdot\nabla\ub=0$.
\item[1]: First-order upwind for momentum.
\item[2]: Second-order central for momentum.  Note that diffusion must be present for stability.  While
it is difficult to perform an exact stability analysis for the unstructured-grid equations, the 1-d
stability limitation requires that 
grid Peclet number according to 
\[
Pe_\Delta<\frac{2}{C}\,,
\]
where $Pe_\Delta = \frac{\max(|U|)\max(D_g)}{\min(\kappa_H)}$ and $C=\frac{\max(|U|)\Delta t}{\max(D_g)}$,
which translates into the requirement that the horizontal diffusion be restricted to
\[
\kappa_H>\frac{\max(|U|)^2\Delta t}{2}\,.
\]

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{newcells: Boolean}

Since the advection of momentum is not conservative in the upper cells, the velocity in the upper cells
can be adjusted to ensure that
\[
U_{top}^{n+1}\Delta z_{top}^{n+1} = 
U_{top}^{n}\Delta z_{top}^{n}\,.
\]
This should be used with caution and results should be checked to make sure this does not alter them
significantly.  Otherwise the upper layer depth is too small relative ot the free surface motions.\\
(0): Do not adjust upper layer cells, (1): Adjust upper layer cells.

\subsubsection{wetdry: Boolean}

Different time-stepping schemes are used for horizontal scalar advection when wetting and drying occur (vertical
advection always uses the $\theta$ method).  To guarantee consistency
with continuity, the $\theta$ method must be used for scalar advection.  This is formally first-order
accurate in time, so results are more accurate when second-order Adams-Bashforth is used if there
is no wetting and drying.  Therefore, the wetdry Boolean is set according to:\\
(0): No wetting and drying, employ AB2 for horizontal scalar advection\\
(1): Wetting and drying: employ $\theta$-method for horizontal scalar advection.

\subsubsection{Coriolis\_f: $f\ge 0$}

Coriolis frequency $f=2\Omega\sin(\phi)$, where $\phi$ is the latitude.

\subsubsection{sponge\_distance: $D_{sponge}\ge 0$}

An example of how to implement a sponge layer is shown in \verb+phys.c+ in the form
\[
\frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t} = -\frac{1}{\tau_{sponge}}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{D_{sponge}}\right)\,,
\]
where the $\tau_{sponge}$ timescale is defined by the value of sponge\_decay.  If $D_{sponge}=0$ then
no sponge layer is employed.  {\bf Note that this sponge layer assumes the boundary is located at $x=0$
and that the sponge layer is roughly $D_{sponge}$ m thick and extends in the positive $x$ direction!}

\subsubsection{sponge\_decay: $\tau_{sponge}>0$}

Decay timescale for sponge layer.

\subsubsection{readSalinity: Boolean}

(0): Vertical salinity distribution is specified in \verb+initilization.c+\\
(1): Read vertical salinity distribution from the file specified by the InitSalinityFile parameter.
This file must be in binary form and must contain $N_{kmax}$ double precision values in top-to-bottom
order.

\subsubsection{readTemperature: Boolean}

(0): Vertical temperature distribution is specified in \verb+initilization.c+\\
(1): Read vertical temperature distribution from the file specified by the InitTemperatureFile parameter.
This file must be in binary form and must contain $N_{kmax}$ double precision values in top-to-bottom
order.

\subsection{Input/Output files}

These parameters define the names of the input files.  The syntax of the line in suntans.dat is given by
\begin{verbatim}
filespecifier  fileprefix   # Description of parameter

Global files do not contain the processor suffix, while per-processor files contain the processor
number as the suffix.
For example, in a four-processor run, there will be four i/o files relating
