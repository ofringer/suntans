Examples can be run with "make test".

This will run both cases of 

+ testXY 
+ testXZ 

These simulate cavity flows in the XY and XZ planes, respectively
with data in dataXY and dataXZ.  
CompareResultsXY.m and CompareResultsXZ.m can be used to view data 
with some results from Zang (1994) data. 
"make plotXY" and "make plotXZ" can also be used to view the 
data with sunplot.
