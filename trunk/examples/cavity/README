This test case computes a lid-driven cavity flow on triangular and 
quadrilateral grids.  There are four cases:

Default: "make test" runs testXY

make testXY
     Flow is in the x-y (unstructured) plane and forced at u(y=0)=1, with
     all other boundaries no-slip.
     Grid: Unstructured in x-y, with high-resolution at boundary layers with
     	   a total of 4016 cells.

make testXY-quad:
     Same as make testXY but with quadrilateral cells.
     Grid: 30X30 Cartesian grid with Chebychev stretching at the boundaries.

make testXZ:
     Flow is in the x-z plane and forced at w(x=0)=-1, with
     all other boundaries no-slip.  
     Grid: 128 Constant-width equilateral triangles in x, 128 equispaced
     	   z-levels.

make testXZ-quad:
     Same as testXZ but with quadrilaterals in the x-direction.
     Grid: 30 Chebychev quadrilaterals in both x and z.
