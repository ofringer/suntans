How to run this example.  For details please see the user guide.

Upon downloading, the tidal component data already exists in the
rundata directory in the file rundata/tidecomponents.dat.0.  Therefore,
the steps below outline how to run the example for two cases:
A) Directly from the repository.
B) If new tidal data is created (if, for example, the grid or number of 
processors is changed).
----------------------------------------------------------------
A) DIRECTLY FROM THE REPOSITORY

1) Edit ../../Makefile.in

2) Make sure the paths in the first three lines of setup_tides.m are correct.
Also make sure the suntides data is uncompressed by entering the suntides
directory and typing "make".

3) Run suntans

make test

4) Compare the output to OTIS with compare_to_otis.m

----------------------------------------------------------------
B) IF NEW TIDAL DATA IS NEEDED

1) Edit ../../Makefile.in

2) Make sure the paths in the first three lines of setup_tides.m are correct.
Also make sure the suntides data is uncompressed by entering the suntides
directory and typing "make".

3) Remove tidecomponents.dat.* files in rundata (or copy them to another 
location)

4) Run suntans and create the tidexy.dat files. 

make test

An error will result, complaining of lack of tidecomponent.dat.* files.
tidexy.dat.* files are created instead, these contain locations needed by tides.m to create tidecomponent.dat.* files.  Note that no error will result
if the correct tidecomponents.dat.* file(s) exist in rundata/, or if the
tidecomponents.dat.* files are not removed as in step 3.

5) To create the tidecomponents.dat.* files, run tides.m in matlab, i.e.

matlab < tides.m

If matlab is installed locally on unix then you can type "make tides"

6) Run the example again with

make test

This will use the new tidecomponents.dat.* files.

7) Compare the output to OTIS with compare_to_otis.m

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that the edges-3.dat file in rundata/ contains edges of type 3.  This
can be used to test tidal boundaries of type 3.
