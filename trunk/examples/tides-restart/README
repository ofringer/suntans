This is the same as the ../tides example except it employs
10 restart runs.  You will need to obtain the tidecomponents.dat.* files
from ../tides by running tides.m in that directory and placing
tidecomponents.dat.* into rundata/.  (or just copy over from
./tide_data).
----------------------------------------------------------------
1) Edit ../../Makefile.in

2) Run the example

make test

3) This will create 10 data{1,2,3,...,10} directories, each with
output from the 10 runs.  It will also create data/fs.dat.prof and
data/u.dat.prof, which is a concatiation of all of the files in
each of the individual data* directories.  The results in each of
the data/*.dat.prof files can then be checked by moving them to
../tides/data (along with the appropriate files necessary to run
tides_compare.m) and comparing to otis data using tides_compare.m
in the ../tides/ directory.
