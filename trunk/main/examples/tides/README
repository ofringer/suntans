How to run this example.  For details please see the user guide.
----------------------------------------------------------------
1) Edit ../../Makefile.in

2) Make sure the paths in the first three lines of setup_tides.m are correct.
Also make sure the suntides data is uncompressed by entering the suntides
directory and typing "make".

3) Run suntans and create the tidexy.dat files.

make test

Error will result, complaining of lack of tidecomponent.dat.* files.
tidexy.dat.* files are created instead, these contain locations needed by tides.m
to create tidecomponent.dat.* files.

4) Run tides.m in matlab, i.e.

matlab < tides.m

5) Run the example again with

make test

6) Compare the output to OTIS with compare_to_otis.m
