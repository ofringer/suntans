How to run this example.  For details please see the user guide.
----------------------------------------------------------------
1) Edit ../../Makefile.in

2) Make sure the paths in the first three lines of setup_tides.m are correct.
Also make sure the suntides data is uncompressed by entering the suntides
directory and typing "make".

3) Run suntans and create the tidexy.dat files. (note that the 
tidecomponents.dat.* files have been added to the rundata directory
so this step can be skipped.  However this step is required if the
tidecomponents.dat.* files are not there).

make test

Error will result, complaining of lack of tidecomponent.dat.* files.
tidexy.dat.* files are created instead, these contain locations needed by tides.m
to create tidecomponent.dat.* files.

4) Run tides.m in matlab, i.e.

matlab < tides.m

5) Run the example again with

make test

6) Compare the output to OTIS with compare_to_otis.m
