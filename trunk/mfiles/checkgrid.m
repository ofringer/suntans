% CHECKGRID Check Voronoi distances on an unstructured grid.
%   CHECKGRID(DGMIN,NBINS,EDGESFILE,CELLSFILE) checks an 
%   unstructured grid defined by the EDGESFILE and CELLSFILE
%   for Voronoi distances (distances between Voronoi points on either 
%   side of an edge) that are less than DGMIN, and displays those edges in
%   red on a plot of the Voronoi points.  This function also plots
%   a histogram of the Voronoi distances with the number of bins
%   as NBINS.
